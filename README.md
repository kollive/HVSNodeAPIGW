# basic-node-server

This is a basic Node.js server based on Express that uses ES2015 features and therefore requires Node.js v6 or higher.

It is used as a boilerplate for explaining how to move a JS project to TypeScript.

Setup steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dkundel/basic-node-server.git -b typescript-boilerplate
cd basic-node-server
npm install
npm start
```
